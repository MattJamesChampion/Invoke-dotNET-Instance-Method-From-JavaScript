# Invoke .NET Instance Method From JavaScript

This project is designed to go with [a blog post I wrote on invoking .NET instance methods directly form JavaScript](https://mattjameschampion.com/2022/02/08/calling-net-instance-methods-in-asp-net-core-blazor-directly-from-javascript/). Hopefully it helps!
